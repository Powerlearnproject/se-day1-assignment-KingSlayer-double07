#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the building and maintenance of software applications. It involves everything that has to do with the development cycle of a software applocation and the maintenance of the same application to ensure that it continues to serve the users efficiently. Software engineering is important to the technology industry because it is the process of building applications that help streamline various processes in the tech industry.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The Beginning of Software Engineering - This happened at a conference organized by NATO in 1968. The term "Software Engineering" was first introduced and it's aim was to apply engineering principles to make software more reliable and efficient because programs were becomming more complex and this was causing a rise in the amount of failures.
2. Rise of Structured Programming (1970s - 1980s) - Programmers initially wrote code in an unstructured way, making code difficult to read and maintain (spaghetti code). Structured programming introduced concepts like functions, loops and conditional statements which made the code easier to read and maintain.
3. The Birth of Agile Methodologies (2001 - present) - The waterfall model was too rigid for fast-paced software development so in 2001, the agile manifesto was introduced which focused on iterative development, collaboration and customer feedback.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Project Planning - The initial plans for the software is made, where the project's scope, requirements and feasibility is defined.
2. Program Requirements - The features required by the user is analysed
3. System Design - The bluprint design of how the system would work is created
4. Implementation - Developers build the actual codebase of the system
5. Testing - QA engineers test the software to confirm that it works as intended
6. Project Deployment - The software is made available for users to access
7. Project Maintenance - Bugs are fixed and new features are added to the project as time goes by


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

1. Feature - The waterfall model is sequential while the agile method is iterative.
2. Flexibility - The waterfall model is more rigid because one stage must be completed before moving to the next while the agile model allows for adjustment based on feedback.
3. Customer Involvement - With the waterfall model, customer involvement is minimal until the final product is delivered but with the agile methodology, the customer is constantly involved to provide feedback as development goes on.
4. Best Use - Waterfall model is best for large projects with clear and stable requirements while the agile model is best for dynamic projects with flexible requirements
5. Example Scenario - the waterfall methodology can be used to develop a banking system because the security and regulatory requirements must be met before launch while the agile methodology can be used by a startup trying to build a mobile app to solve certain needs in the environment because the features could change based on feedback from users.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software Developer:
                    - Writes and maintain code
                    - Converts project requirements into functional software
                    - Collaborates with the QA engineer and project manager to refine the product.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer:
                    - Tests the Software to detect any issues
                    - Ensures the project meets the required standard
                    - Works with the developer to fix any issues before release
3. Project Manager:
                   - Oversees the project timeline, budget and resources
                   - Serves as an interface between the developer, QA engineer and other stakeholders
                   - Ensures the project meets business goals


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs (like VS Code, IntelliJ and NetBeans) provide features like code completion, debugging and syntax highlighting allowing developers to save time while also reducing errors. VCS (like Git, GitHub) allow developers to track changes, work in teams and revert to previous versions thereby reducing the possibilities of losing work and making it easier to collaborate.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Debugging complex bugs → Use logging tools, debuggers, and read documentations
2. Keeping up with new technologies → Follow tech blogs and join developer communities
3. Tight deadlines → Use Agile methodologies, prioritize tasks, and communicate effectively with the team
4. Code conflicts in teamwork → Use VCS and follow proper branching strategies


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit Testing – Tests individual components
2. Integration Testing – Ensures different parts of the system work together
3. System Testing – Verifies the entire application’s functionality
4. Acceptance Testing – Confirms that the final product meets user expectations


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

 Prompt engineering is the process of designing effective input for AI models to generate effective and relevant responses. A better prompt increases the likelihood of better responses. AI also works using GIGO.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 
Vague Prompt -> "Tell me about the second world war"
Improved Prompt -> "Summarize the key events of World War II in five points"
Explanation -> The improved prompt is clear because it mentions the exact kind of explanation needed (a summarized explanation in five points). It is also specific in that it specifies the number of points (five) and the exact kind of detail (key events). It is concise as there are no excessive words.
